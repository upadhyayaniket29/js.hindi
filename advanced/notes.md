Why use OOP

parts of OOP
# Object literal

Constructor function : give every time the new instances 
Prototypes
Classes
Instances (new, this)


# 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation 
Inheritance 
Polymorphism

1>Abstraction means hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities.
2>An object literal is a simple way to create an object in JavaScript using curly braces {}. It allows you to define properties and methods directly within the object.


//Use of new in js
/*
1. Step one an empty new object is created 
2. constructor function call due to new keyword
3. this keyword and argument got injected in this empty object
4. we got in function (Output)  


*/

2️⃣ Methods
Methods are functions inside an object.
They define behavior or actions that the object can perform.
Methods can access and manipulate properties of the same object using this.

Properties → Store data inside an object.
Methods → Define actions for an object.
